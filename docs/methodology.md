# Kiro-SDD Methodology

## Overview

Kiro-SDD (Specification-Driven Development) is a systematic approach to software development that addresses the fundamental disconnect between AI-generated code and actual business requirements.

## The Problem

### The 70% Rewrite Phenomenon

In AI-assisted development, we consistently observe that approximately 70% of generated database queries need to be rewritten during frontend-backend integration. This occurs due to:

1. **Premature Convergence**: AI attempts to solve database, API, and UI concerns simultaneously
2. **Specification Drift**: Lack of clear boundaries between development phases
3. **Assumption Cascade**: Each assumption compounds, leading to systemic misalignment
4. **Missing Feedback Loops**: No validation between phases

### Real-World Impact

- **Time Loss**: 3-4x longer development cycles
- **Quality Issues**: Inconsistent implementations
- **Technical Debt**: Accumulated from hasty fixes
- **Team Frustration**: Constant rework demoralizes developers

## The Solution

### Core Principles

#### 1. Separation of Concerns

Each phase focuses on a single aspect:
- **Requirements**: WHAT needs to be built
- **Use Cases**: WHO uses it and HOW
- **Sequences**: WHEN things happen
- **Schema**: WHERE data lives
- **API**: HOW systems communicate
- **Interfaces**: WHAT data looks like
- **Tests**: HOW we verify
- **Design**: HOW it's architected
- **Tasks**: WHAT gets implemented

#### 2. Approval Gates

Human review between each phase ensures:
- Alignment with business goals
- Technical feasibility
- Consistency across specifications

#### 3. Specification References

Every implementation task must reference:
- Source specification section
- Related specifications
- Test specifications

#### 4. Incremental Validation

Continuous validation through:
- Status checks
- Reference validation
- Coverage analysis

## Specification Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements Definition

**Focus**: Business needs and user stories

**Outputs**:
- User stories in EARS format
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Acceptance criteria

**Key Questions**:

**Outputs**:
- Type definitions
- Validation schemas
- Data transformations
- Contract tests

**Key Questions**:
- What are the data shapes?
- How do we ensure type safety?
- What validations are needed?

### Phase 7: Test Specification

**Focus**: Verification and validation

**Outputs**:
- Unit test scenarios
- Integration test plans
- E2E test cases
- Performance criteria

**Key Questions**:
- How do we verify correctness?
- What are the test boundaries?
- How do we measure success?

### Phase 8: Technical Design

**Focus**: Architecture and implementation

**Outputs**:
- Component architecture
- Design patterns
- Security measures
- Performance strategies

**Key Questions**:
- How is it built?
- What patterns apply?
- How do we ensure quality?

### Phase 9: Task Breakdown

**Focus**: Implementation planning

**Outputs**:
- Task list with references
- Dependencies
- Acceptance criteria
- Time estimates

**Key Questions**:
- What needs to be done?
- In what order?
- How do we verify completion?

## Implementation Strategy

### The Reference System

Every task must include:

```markdown
- [ ] Implement user login endpoint
  - Reference: api.md#post-auth-login
  - Reference: interfaces.md#LoginRequest
  - Reference: tests-red.md#login-tests
  - Acceptance: All tests pass, response < 200ms
```

### Benefits of References

1. **Traceability**: Every line of code traces to requirements
2. **Consistency**: Implementation matches specification
3. **Validation**: Easy to verify completeness
4. **Maintenance**: Changes propagate clearly

## Approval Workflow

### Interactive Approvals

Commands prompt for approval:
```
Have you reviewed requirements.md? [y/N]
```

Answering 'y':
- Updates approval status
- Allows progression to next phase
- Logs approval timestamp

### Manual Approvals

Edit `spec.json` directly:
```json
"approvals": {
  "requirements": {
    "generated": true,
    "approved": true,
    "approved_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "approved_by": "manual"
  }
}
```

## Validation and Verification

### Status Checking

```bash
/kiro:spec-status feature-name
```

Provides:
- Phase completion status
- Approval status
- Next steps
- Blockers

### Reference Validation

```bash
/kiro:spec-validate feature-name
```

Ensures:
- All tasks have references
- References point to valid sections
- No orphaned specifications
- Complete requirement coverage

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: API-First Development

1. Start with API specification
2. Derive interfaces from API
3. Design schema to support API
4. Create tests for contracts
5. Implement with confidence

### Pattern 2: Data-First Development

1. Begin with schema design
2. Build API around data model
3. Create interfaces from schema
4. Test data integrity
5. Implement with type safety

### Pattern 3: Test-First Development

1. Write test specifications first
2. Derive interfaces from tests
3. Design API to pass tests
4. Schema supports test cases
5. Implementation guided by tests

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Skipping Phases

**Problem**: Jumping from requirements to implementation
**Result**: Misaligned implementation
**Solution**: Follow all phases, even if briefly

### Anti-Pattern 2: Retroactive Specifications

**Problem**: Writing specs after implementation
**Result**: Specifications don't match reality
**Solution**: Always specify before implementing

### Anti-Pattern 3: Ignored Approvals

**Problem**: Auto-approving without review
**Result**: Cascading errors
**Solution**: Genuine review at each gate

### Anti-Pattern 4: Missing References

**Problem**: Tasks without specification links
**Result**: Implementation drift
**Solution**: Mandatory reference validation

## Metrics and Success

### Key Metrics

1. **Specification Coverage**: % of code with spec references
2. **First-Time Success**: % of implementations passing tests initially
3. **Rework Rate**: % of code requiring changes post-implementation
4. **Approval Time**: Average time per phase approval
5. **Defect Origin**: % of bugs traceable to specification gaps

### Success Indicators

- **< 10% Rework Rate**: Specifications align with implementation
- **> 90% Coverage**: Comprehensive specification references
- **< 1 Day Approval**: Efficient review process
- **> 80% First-Time Success**: Clear specifications
