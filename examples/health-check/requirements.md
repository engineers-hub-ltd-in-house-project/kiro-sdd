# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The health check endpoint provides a standardized way to monitor the application's operational status and verify critical system dependencies. This feature enables infrastructure monitoring tools, load balancers, and container orchestration platforms to determine if the application is ready to handle requests and functioning correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Basic Health Status Endpoint

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to check if the application is running and responsive, so that I can monitor system availability and configure health checks in load balancers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/health` THEN the system SHALL return an HTTP 200 status code with a JSON response containing status information
2. IF the application is running normally THEN the system SHALL return a response within 100 milliseconds
3. WHEN the endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL NOT require authentication or authorization
4. WHERE the response is generated THE SYSTEM SHALL include a status field with value "ok" when all checks pass
5. WHEN the response is generated THEN the system SHALL include a timestamp field with the current UTC time in ISO 8601 format

### Requirement 2: Database Connectivity Check

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that the application can connect to the database, so that I can detect database connectivity issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health check endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity by executing a simple query
2. IF the database connection is successful THEN the system SHALL include "database": "connected" in the response
3. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL include "database": "disconnected" in the response
4. WHEN checking database connectivity THEN the system SHALL use a timeout of 5 seconds
5. IF the database check times out THEN the system SHALL treat it as a failed connection
6. WHILE performing the database check THE SYSTEM SHALL use the existing connection pool without creating new connections

### Requirement 3: Response Structure and Format

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want a consistent and predictable response format from the health check endpoint, so that I can easily parse and process the health status information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health check succeeds THEN the system SHALL return a JSON response with the following structure:
   - status: string ("ok" or "error")
   - timestamp: string (ISO 8601 format)
   - database: string ("connected" or "disconnected")
   - version: string (application version)
2. IF any health check component fails THEN the system SHALL set the overall status to "error"
3. WHEN returning the response THEN the system SHALL use Content-Type "application/json"
4. WHERE version information is included THE SYSTEM SHALL read it from the application's configuration or build metadata

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Degraded States

**User Story:** As a monitoring system, I want to distinguish between a completely failed service and a partially degraded service, so that I can make informed decisions about routing traffic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the application is running but the database is disconnected THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 with status "degraded"
2. IF the application cannot respond at all THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
3. WHEN an internal error occurs during health checking THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 with an error status
4. WHERE errors are logged THE SYSTEM SHALL record health check failures in the application logs with appropriate severity levels
5. IF the health check fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL NOT cause cascading failures or resource exhaustion

### Requirement 5: Performance and Resource Usage

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the health check endpoint to be lightweight and efficient, so that frequent polling doesn't impact application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health check is executed THEN the system SHALL complete all checks within 100 milliseconds under normal conditions
2. WHILE health checks are running THE SYSTEM SHALL use minimal CPU and memory resources
3. IF health checks are called frequently THEN the system SHALL implement result caching with a 1-second TTL
4. WHEN caching is used THEN the system SHALL include a "cached" field in the response indicating whether the result is from cache
5. WHERE database checks are performed THE SYSTEM SHALL reuse existing connections from the connection pool

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Security
- The endpoint must be accessible without authentication to support infrastructure monitoring
- The endpoint must not expose sensitive information about the system internals
- The endpoint must be rate-limited to prevent abuse (maximum 10 requests per second per IP)

### Reliability
- The health check must be independent of other application features
- The health check must not cause the application to crash or become unresponsive
- The health check must handle all error conditions gracefully

### Observability
- All health check requests must be logged with response time and result
- Failed health checks must generate appropriate log entries for debugging
- Metrics should be exported for monitoring dashboard integration
